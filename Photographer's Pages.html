	<p><br>We've been into photography since we got interested in taking pictures and that was 10 years ago. There’s this excitement of waking up early in the morning to capture the sunrise and the fulfillment of waiting in a beach for the sun as it sets in the horizon, the amazing burst of colors that only the camera captures the moment. And not only this have had we wanted to capture every event in the lives of people. Like, a child’s blessing in Gods home to his first blowing candles, young ladys 18th celebration, couples holy matrimony and not to forget them their pre-nuptial, fashion show events and many more.</br>
	<br>We give our best and value that photos we shoot, because photography is an art of capturing moments that will last forever. </p>
